        <h4>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel was a senior leader of Indian National Congress and a prominent figure in the Indian Freedom Struggle, 
            who later became India’s first Deputy Prime Minister and first Home Minister.</h4>
        <p>Sardar Patel’s contribution in integrating 565 princely states into a newly independent India is unforgettable.</p>
        <h2>Vallabhbhai Patel’s early life</h2>
        <p>Vallabhbhai Patel was born in Nadiad, Gujarat, on October 31, 1875 (His birth anniversary is now observed as 
            <b>National Unity Day</b> or <b>Rashtriya Ekta Diwas</b>). <br>
            In his early years, Patel was considered by many as an unambitious man destined for a commonplace job. However, 
            Patel proved them wrong. He passed law examination, often studying himself, with borrowed books. <br>
            Patel practised law at Godhra, Borsad, and Anand in Gujarat, after passing the bar examination. 
            He earned the reputation of being a fierce and skilled lawyer. 
        </p>


        <h2>Patel’s early willingness to sacrifice for others</h2>
        <p>Patel had a dream to study law in England. Using his hard-earned savings, 
            he managed to get a pass and ticket to go to England. <br>

            However, the ticket was addressed to ‘V.J. Patel’. His elder brother Vithalbhai also had the same initials as Vallabhai. 
            Sardar Patel came to know that his elder brother too cherished a dream to go to England for studies. <br>
            
            In keeping with concerns for his family’s honour (disreputable for an older brother to follow his younger brother), 
            Vallabhbhai Patel allowed Vithalbhai Patel to go, in his place.</p>


        <h2>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s role in the Indian Freedom Movement</h2>
        <p>Patel joined the Congress and became the secretary of the Gujarat Sabha that became a Congress stronghold later. <br>

            On Gandhi’s call, Patel quit his hard-earned job and joined the movement to fight for exemption of taxes in Kheda 
            at the time of plague and famine (1918). <br>
            
            Patel joined Gandhi’s Non-Cooperation Movement (1920) and travelled around West India to recruit 3,00,000 members. 
            He also collected more than Rs 1.5 million for the party fund. <br>
            
            There was a British law banning the hoisting of the Indian Flag. When Mahatma Gandhi was imprisoned, it was Patel 
            who led the Satyagraha movement in Nagpur in 1923 against the British law. <br>
            In 1930, British arrested Sardar Patel during the Salt Satyagraha and put him on trial without witnesses. <br>

            On the outbreak of World War II (1939), Patel the supported Nehru’s decision to withdraw the Congress from central and 
            provincial legislatures. <br>

            Patel was at his persuasive best when he spoke at the Gwalia Tank ground (now called August Kranti Maidan) in Mumbai to 
            launch the nation-wide civil disobedience movement in 1942 at the behest of Mahatma Gandhi. <br>
            During Quit India Movement (1942), the British arrested Patel. He was imprisoned with the entire Congress Working 
            Committee from 1942 to 1945 at the fort in Ahmednagar. <br>
        </p>


        <h2>Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s role in the Integration of the princely states</h2>
        <p>Few princely states like Travancore, Hyderabad, Junagadh, Bhopal and Kashmir were averse to joining the state of India. <br>

            Sardar Patel worked tirelessly to build a consensus with the princely states but did not hesitate in employing methods 
            of Sama, Dama, Dand and Bhed where ever necessary. <br>
            
            He had used force to annex princely states of Junagadh ruled by Nawab and Hyderabad ruled by Nizam, 
            both of whom had wished not to merge their respective states with Union of India. <br>
            
            Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel stitched the princely states along with British Indian territory and 
            prevented balkanization of India.</p>
